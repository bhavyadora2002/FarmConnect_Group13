# FarmConnect




## **1. Vision**
FarmConnect is a lightweight web application that helps farmers list available produce, buyers place purchase requests, and transporters manage delivery tasks. It replaces scattered phone calls and manual coordination with a clean, structured workflow. This is a success if a user can list produce, a buyer can request it, and a transporter can complete the delivery.

## **2. Users**

### 2. Buyer

- Needs: browse produce, request purchase, track order status

### 3. Transporter

## About the implementation

The app allows farmers to list available produce, including basic details such as name, quantity, and price. This gives farmers a clear, organized way to present what they have for sale. Buyers can browse all available produce, request purchases, track the status of their requests, message farmers, and rate their experience. Transporters see approved requests as delivery tasks, accept them, and mark them completed. All of it is backed by a Flask API and a MySQL database, with a React + Vite frontend.

### Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios (`frontend/`)
- **Backend:** Flask, PyMySQL (`backend/app.py`)
- **Database:** MySQL (`backend/schema.sql` creates DB + tables + demo data)

### How to run

```bash
# 1. Database — paste backend/schema.sql into MySQL Workbench and run it
# 2. Backend (port 5000)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# 3. Frontend (port 5173)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and log in with any demo account
(`farmer@farmconnect.com`, `buyer@farmconnect.com`, `transporter@farmconnect.com`, password `password`).

See `QUICK_START.md` and `SETUP.md` for full details.
